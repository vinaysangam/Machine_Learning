# Multivariate Polynomial Regression — Marketing Mix Intelligence

## 📌 Introduction  
This project applies **Multivariate Polynomial Regression** to analyze how:  
- TV Advertising Spend  
- Radio Advertising Spend  
- Newspaper Advertising Spend  

jointly and **non-linearly** influence Sales.  

Unlike standard Multiple Linear Regression which assumes straight-line relationships, Polynomial Regression models:  
✔ Curved relationships  
✔ Diminishing returns  
✔ Interaction effects between channels

## 🧠 What is Multivariate Polynomial Regression?
General polynomial model:

y = β0 + β1x + β2x² + β3x³ … + βnxⁿ

When applied to multiple features, it expands feature space to include:
- Squared terms (TV², Radio², Newspaper²)
- Interaction terms (TV×Radio, TV×Newspaper, Radio×Newspaper)

This enables the model to learn realistic business dynamics.

## 🎯 Why Use It?
Polynomial Regression solves limitations of linear modeling by capturing:
- Non-linear behavior  
- Synergy between marketing channels  
- Saturation / diminishing impact  
- Realistic curved response functions

## 📂 What This Project Includes
✔ Polynomial degree comparison (1,2,3)  
✔ R², RMSE, MAE performance evaluation  
✔ Feature interaction modeling  
✔ Residual diagnostics  
✔ QQ Plot analysis  
✔ Professional business interpretation

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- MAE — Mean Absolute Error  
- RMSE — Root Mean Squared Error  
- R² Score  

Higher R² + Lower Error = Better performance  

---
## 🔍 Business Value
This modeling supports enterprise decision‑making by enabling:
- Marketing ROI understanding  
- Budget optimization  
- Channel effectiveness analysis  
- Data‑driven planning  

---
## ⚠️ Considerations
- Risk of overfitting increases with degree  
- Interpretation complexity increases  
- Polynomial expansion increases feature dimensions  

Degree 2 is typically recommended in real business environments.
