# 🌳 Decision Tree — Classification (Professional README)

This folder contains a **Decision Tree Classification** implementation as part of the supervised learning track in the Machine Learning portfolio.  
The work focuses on **clear implementation, evaluation discipline, interpretability, and enterprise relevance**, with all theoretical explanations consolidated here (outside the notebook).

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this module is to:
- Understand how Decision Trees perform supervised classification
- Build an interpretable, rule-based model
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics
- Develop intuition around overfitting and model complexity

---

## 🧠 What This Notebook Covers

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preparation
- Dataset loading
- Feature / target identification
- Train-test split

### 2️⃣ Model Development — Decision Tree
- Baseline model training
- Prediction generation
- Understanding model behavior

---

## 🧠 What is a Decision Tree?

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning algorithm that:
- Splits data recursively based on feature values
- Forms a tree-like structure of decisions
- Produces predictions at leaf nodes

Each internal node represents a **decision rule**, each branch represents an **outcome**, and each leaf represents a **final prediction**.

## ⚙️ How Decision Trees Work

1. Start with the full dataset at the root
2. Select the best feature to split the data
3. Partition data into child nodes
4. Repeat recursively until a stopping condition is met

---

## 📐 Splitting Criteria

### Gini Impurity
Gini = 1 − Σ(pᵢ²)

### Entropy & Information Gain
Entropy = − Σ(pᵢ log₂ pᵢ)  
Information Gain = Entropy(parent) − Weighted Entropy(children)
