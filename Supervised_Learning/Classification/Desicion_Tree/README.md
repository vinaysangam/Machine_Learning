# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier — Machine Learning Portfolio Project

This notebook delivers a **professional, enterprise-grade implementation of Decision Tree Classification**, aligned with the same rigor and structure as the Random Forest project.  
It focuses on clarity, evaluation discipline, transparency, and practical interpretability — making it suitable for both learning and real‑world analytical work.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a **Decision Tree–based classification model** that is:
- Interpretable
- Statistically evaluated
- Tuned for performance
- Ready for business storytelling

---

## 🧠 What This Notebook Covers

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preparation
- Dataset loading
- Feature / target identification
- Train-test split
- Preprocessing (if required)

---

### 2️⃣ Model Development — Decision Tree
- Baseline model training
- Prediction generation
- Understanding model behavior

---

### 3️⃣ Evaluation & Validation
