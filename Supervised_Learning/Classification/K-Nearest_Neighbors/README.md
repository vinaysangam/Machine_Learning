# 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) — Classification Module  
### Machine Learning | Supervised Learning | Corporate-Grade Implementation

This module is part of the **Machine_Learning → Supervised_Learning → Classification** portfolio and demonstrates a professionally structured implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.

The objective of this work is to showcase:
- Strong ML fundamentals
- Practical, implementation-focused learning
- Enterprise-style documentation
- Evaluation discipline and interpretability

## 📌 What is KNN?

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a **non-parametric, instance-based supervised learning algorithm**.  
It predicts the class of a new data point based on **similarity to existing labeled data**.

In simple terms:
> "A data point is classified by majority vote of its nearest neighbors."

## ⚙️ How KNN Works

1️⃣ Choose a value of **K**  
2️⃣ Compute distance from the query point to every point in training data  
3️⃣ Identify the **K closest neighbors**  
4️⃣ Perform a majority vote  
5️⃣ Assign the final class

## 📐 Distance Metrics

KNN relies heavily on distance measurement. Commonly used metrics include:

- **Euclidean Distance** (default)
- Manhattan Distance
- Minkowski Distance

---

## 🎯 Choosing the Right K

Selecting K is critical:

- Very small K → Overfitting
- Very large K → Underfitting

This project includes:
✔ Accuracy vs K visualization  
✔ Identification of optimal K value  

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

This module follows a professional evaluation standard including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix Visualization

This ensures the model is not only accurate but **reliable and explainable**.

## 🧠 Business Relevance of KNN

KNN is widely used where pattern similarity matters:

- Recommendation Systems
- Pattern Recognition
- Customer Segmentation
- Anomaly Detection
- Medical Diagnosis
- Behavioral Analytics

Its advantages:
✔ Simple and intuitive  
✔ No explicit training required  
✔ Strong for moderately sized datasets
