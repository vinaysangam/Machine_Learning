## 🔷 Clustering
Clustering enables grouping similar data points without predefined labels. It helps discover natural structure and meaningful segments in data.

### 📌 K-Means Clustering
- Partition‑based algorithm
- Requires predefined number of clusters (K)
- Works best for spherical, evenly distributed clusters  
Includes:
- Elbow Method
- Silhouette Score
- Cluster visualization
- Interpretation

---

### 📌 Hierarchical Clustering
- Builds clusters in a tree‑like structure (dendrogram)
- No need to pre‑define K initially
- Supports agglomerative clustering and linkage strategies  
Includes:
- Dendrogram analysis
- Cluster visualization
- Interpretation

---

### 📌 DBSCAN Clustering
- Density‑based clustering algorithm
- Automatically detects number of clusters
- Identifies noise and outliers
- Handles arbitrarily shaped clusters  
Includes:
- eps & minPts exploration
- Noise detection
- Cluster separation visualization
- Interpretation

---

## 🔶 Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is essential for:
- Handling high‑dimensional datasets
