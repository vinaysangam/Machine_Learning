### 3️⃣ Semi_Supervised_Learning (Planned)
A hybrid learning paradigm leveraging **both labeled and unlabeled data**, suitable when labels are limited or expensive to obtain.

---

### 4️⃣ Self_Supervised_Learning (Planned)
Modern learning paradigm where models **generate supervision from the data itself**, widely used in NLP and Computer Vision representation learning.

---

### 5️⃣ Reinforcement_Learning (Planned)
A section focused on training agents through reward‑based interaction environments.

---
